Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically
through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.
Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data,
in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine,
email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to
develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. A subset of machine
learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions
using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of
mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory, and application domains to the field
of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data
analysis through unsupervised learning. Some implementations of machine learning use
data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain. In its
application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive
analytics.
